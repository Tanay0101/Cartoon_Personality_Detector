The data is taken from Kaggle, but I cannot find the dataset again, ping me if you want it.
To improve performance clean the data first, this increased the validation and test accuracy by 8% and 6% respectively. The uploaded notebook trains the model with val_accuracy of 65% and test_accuracy of 60%.
The model uses pretrained inception_weights which can be found online.
